# **Predicting-Coronary-Heart-Disease**  
This data is taken from Kaggle website, it is based on an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. There are two classes – patients having ten year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) and the patients not having ten year risk of future CHD. The dataset provides the patient’s medical history. It includes over 4,000 records and 16 attributes.
### Attributes:
#### Demographic:
• Sex: male or female  
• Age: Age of the patient
#### Behavioral
• Current Smoker: whether or not the patient is a current smoker   
• Cigs Per Day: the number of cigarettes that the person smoked on average in one day. 
#### Medical( history)
• BP Meds: whether or not the patient was on blood pressure medication   
• Prevalent Stroke: whether or not the patient had previously had a stroke   
• Prevalent Hyp: whether or not the patient was hypertensive   
• Diabetes: whether or not the patient had diabetes 
#### Medical(current)
• Tot Chol: total cholesterol level   
• Sys BP: systolic blood pressure   
• Dia BP: diastolic blood pressure   
• BMI: Body Mass Index   
• Heart Rate: heart rate   
• Glucose: glucose level 
#### Predict variable (desired target)
• 10 year risk of coronary heart disease CHD

### Class level Details:
Provide details about how many classes are there in the dataset
              There are two classes – patients having ten-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) and the patients not having ten-year risk of future CHD.  
Why Data Mining is required for this dataset?
Data mining is basically used to extract useful information from raw dataset. The dataset I have chosen is taken from Kaggle website, it is based on an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. There are two classes – patients having ten-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) and the patients not having ten-year risk of future CHD. The dataset provides the patient’s medical history. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. 
            The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high-risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. In this study we intend to highlight the most relevant risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using data mining techniques. Since our target variable is categorical or Boolean, we use Logistic regression in this study.
